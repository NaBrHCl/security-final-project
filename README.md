# Security Final Project

This project uses a variety of encryption techniques in combination to provide encryption and decryption of files.

Users can choose from classical methods like Caesar cipher, sequence reversal, and VigenÃ¨re cipher to encrypt their messages. Transformations are applied in the sequence specified in a key file, which can be generated using the program itself. The program also supports decryption to restore the original message.
